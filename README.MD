# Dagre D3 ClojureScript Examples

Examples of Dagre D3 graph build through ClojureScript.
Note that there is explicit dependency on D3v5.
D3V6 and above are using some babel transformation that 
I am not sure how to work around them.

## Run

```bash
npx shadow-cljs watch frontend
```

This will run a devserver on localhost:8080.
